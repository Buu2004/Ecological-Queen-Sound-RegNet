# RegNet: A High-Performance Deep Learning Model for Queenless State Detection in Beehives
## Abstract
Honey bees play a crucial role in pollination, supporting ecosystem balance and agricultural productivity. \textcolor{red}{The queen bee is essential for hive cohesion, but her presence can often be inferred through the colony’s overall behavior and condition rather than direct monitoring.} This study proposes a non-invasive approach using deep learning techniques to analyze spectrogram features obtained from Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), to detect the queenless condition in beehives. We evaluate five convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures—ResNet-50, EfficientNet, RegNet, ViT and CaiT—on two datasets from different beehives. A customized transfer learning strategy is employed to enhance model performance. Experimental results show that RegNetY consistently outperforms other models, achieving the highest accuracy and F1-score across both datasets and feature types, indicating its robustness and generalizability in detecting hive states.
